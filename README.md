# Dirigible Labs

Dirigible Labs is a community of open source projects that build technology based on the Eclipse Dirigible Cloud Development Platform. It provides the infrastructure services required by open source projects, such as code repositories, bug tracking, project web sites and wikis.

## Adding Your Project

To add your existing GitHub repository as a Dirigible Labs project, open an issue against this repository and one of our administrators will guide you through the process.

##Disclaimer
Dirigible Labs projects are not official Eclipse Foundation projects. Dirigible Labs projects are not hosted by the Eclipse Foundation and do not have to follow the Eclipse Foundation development and intellectual property policies.

There are a number of things Dirigible Labs projects cannot do since they are not official Eclipse Foundation projects:
* They cannot include the word Eclipse in their name.
* They cannot use the org.eclipse namespace for their bundles names
* They cannot participate in the annual Eclipse release trains, unless they are included in an official Eclipse project.
